Description
  Strike Team Penguin is a first person shooter with an explorable and interactable (working on interactable) environment. 
  
  Starting the game
    Press start game in the main menu
    
  Dying
   As you probably could guess if the enemies shoot you, then you lose health, and if you health drops below zero you die. When this happens a game over screen is displayed. From these screen you can restart or quit the game
   
  How To Play
    Walk around the map and shoot the enemies to kill them. The enemies are the white rectangles that really don't like you getting too close. The way you actually win the game, however, is to interact with the cylinder at the end of the map. You can reach it by walking out the house, and finding the big stairs to the left. Go up those stairs and through the fallen door. At the end that path you will find the cylinder in a small stucture in the middle of a large open circular part of the map. If these instructions are not clear then just follow the trail of angry rectangles. Unpon interacting with the cylinder you will be presented with the win screen where you can return to main menu or quit the game.
