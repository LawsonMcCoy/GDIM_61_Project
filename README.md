## Description <br />
Strike Team Penguins (STP) is a 3D FPS game where players control penguin Agent Gwen and fight against the corrupted robots that have overtaken the world. Their mission is to save humanity from the rule of Mr.Snuggles — the evilest and most vicious robot on the planet. The game’s pillars are exploration, story, aiming and shooting, and interactivity.
  
## Synopsis <br />
The game is set in a world where AI is used to make life easier for humankind. However, one fatal experiment goes wrong and creates a threat to all humanity — Mr. Snuggles. To defeat the powerful robot, humans have resorted to G.W.E.N.: Genetically Weaponized, Enhanced Nugget. Mr. Snuggles' next target is the innocent civilians of a small town located in the midst of a mountain valley. Almost at the brink of extinction, humanity’s last hope lies in the flaps of Agent Gwen.

Will Agent Gwen save the world or fall in a monumental battle?


  
## Starting the game <br />
   Press "start" button on the main menu.
    
## Win condition <br />
  The player needs to find 4 barrels that are dispersed across the map. To collect the barrels, the player needs to use the interact button which will teleport the barrels to their stations. After collecting all four items, the player needs to find a computer placed in the center of a gazebo and interact with it.

    
## Death condition <br />
Once the player’s health bar drops below zero, the player will die. This will trigger a game over screen to pop up. From this screen, you can restart or quit the game.

   
## How To Play <br />
- The player can walk around the map and shoot the enemies.
- The player can speedwalk (move faster).  
- The player can switch between 2 firing modes: primary projectile (mouse1/right trigger) and secondary hit scan (mouse2/left trigger). 
- The enemies are robots and will get aggravated if the player approaches them.
- The robots will continue following the player, as long as they are within the detection range, but out of firing range.
- The player needs to find 4 barrels and interact with a computer in order to win

p.s.: refer to the supplementary document for more information on the barrel and computer placement.
